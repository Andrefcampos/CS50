This project aims to implement any project of the student's choice in Scratch, be it an interactive story, game, animation, or anything else, subject only to the following requirements:

- The project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must look like something other than a cat.
- The project must have at least three scripts in total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
- The project must use at least one condition.
- The project must use at least one loop.
- The project must use at least one variable.
- The project must use at least one sound.
-The project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in class (many of which, while instructive, were quite short), but it can be less complex than Ivy's Hardest Game. As such, the project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.
